How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

by viwe all changes in a good looking schedule.


hello



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

because git is used by programmers that would like to see two files in one commit, 

but google docs is for editing regular documents.



How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I'd use them to see all statistics of all changes of files



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

as I'd see all changes I can detect the bugs and all mistakes in the code




Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

for a laravel web aplication project.
